# TrackerPathing
This repo contains a web app which displays a map using the Marker and Polyline feature to visualize GPS tracker coordinates. Code is heavily adapted from Google Maps API guides. It also includes a quick Java program to convert large amounts of GPS coordinates to the appropriate formatting for pasting into the web app.
